**Hi, I’m Fan Xuejiao (Ariel).**  
I work at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence & Law**—algorithmic justice, data governance, and socio-technical design.

I’m currently preparing PhD applications focused on **algorithmic bias & discrimination**, **participatory auditing**, and **legal-tech for accountability**. Previously at **Beijing Institute of Technology** (MA Intelligent Technology & Law; GPA 3.70/4.00). I build things too: legal knowledge graphs, auditing toolkits, and reproducible research pipelines.

**Focus areas**
- Algorithmic fairness & data justice (law-in-the-loop)
- Governance-ready safety evaluations (calibration, risk-coverage)
- Legal knowledge graphs & judicial analytics
- Responsible AI for public institutions (policing, courts, regulators)

**Currently**
- Polishing PhD proposals; publishing code notebooks & mini-demos
- Converging my projects into an open **AI-Law Audit Lab**

> Motto: *Make models safer, evidence tighter, and governance actually usable.*
