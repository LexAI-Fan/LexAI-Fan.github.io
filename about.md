I’m Fan Xuejiao (Ariel), a researcher and builder at the **AI × Law** boundary.  
My work combines legal reasoning, quantitative methods, and careful engineering to turn “responsible AI” from posters into **evidence-based, enforceable practice**.

## Research interests
- **Algorithmic justice & discrimination**: intersectional harms, fairness under distribution shift, participatory auditing
- **Governance-ready evaluation**: calibrated uncertainty, risk-coverage curves, selective abstention/deferral
- **Judicial & regulatory informatics**: legal knowledge graphs, explainable analytics for courts and agencies
- **Data governance**: portability, accountability, and interoperable evidence trails

## Education
- **MA (Juris Master) — Intelligent Technology & Law**, Beijing Institute of Technology (GPA 3.70/4.00)  
- **BA — International Economics & Trade**, Xi’an Foreign Affairs University (GPA 3.30/4.00)

## Selected highlights
- Built a **legal knowledge graph** from >10k Chinese court decisions to study liability patterns and doctrine drift.
- Prototyped **Participatory Harm Auditing** workflows (PHAWM)—community-in-the-loop issue capture → test design → evidence packaging for decision-makers.
- Drafted proposals on **algorithmic justice in law enforcement** (predictive systems; uncertainty-aware controls).
- Wrote compliance-minded tooling (Python, Jupyter) for **reproducible legal-tech evaluations**.

## Skills
**Law & Policy:** data protection, administrative/civil/commercial law, compliance reviews  
**Data/ML:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, transformers, evaluation design, visualization  
**Tooling:** Git/GitHub, Jupyter, Markdown/LaTeX, basic web (HTML/CSS)  
**Languages:** Chinese (native), English (IELTS 6.5)

## Contact
- **Email:** [fanlaplace369@gmail.com](mailto:fanlaplace369@gmail.com)  
- **GitHub:** [LexAI-Fan](https://github.com/LexAI-Fan)  
- **Interests outside work:** piano & guzheng, table tennis, reading in quiet rooms (my natural habitat).

> Fun truth: I like forward-looking governance so much I add version numbers to my plans. (Yes, even for tea.)
